# Module 7: Choose Your Adventure 

This week is "Choose Your Adventure" week where you go deeper on a topic of your choice - this could be Excel or Google Sheets, SQL, BI tooling (see the PowerBI file in this folder), Data Visualization, or even trying your hand at Python or R if you are interested! Using our class format  - find a series of video lessons and watch and complete them. Then choose a data set and analyze it in your preferred tool, leveraging the video lesson you watched to complete the assignment. Goal = Spend 10 hours on the topic of your choice.
